## Ground Rules
* Make sure everyone is in agreement
* When using Slack, create a new thread for each topic, and reply in thread to each topic. This will help keep the Slack channel clean and easy to follow.
* Have respectful and open discussions on ideas, problems, blockers, and concerns
* Don't wait too long before reaching out for help
* Attend team meetings
* Team will agree upon who is responsible for tasks to ensure even distribution of responsibilities
* Inform the team if you are behind on a task that is assigned to you
* Try to keep comments concise and direct
* Don't clutter the Slack communication channel, reply in thread as much as possible.
* Except for small changes to design documentation all features, bugfixes, and other coding work will be completed on a separate feature branch in git.
